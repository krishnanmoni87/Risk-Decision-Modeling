# Risk-Decision-Modeling
This is my Master's degree dissertation project I completed for TSSA

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The aim of the study is to investigate the elevator devices’ (ED) regulatory control in Toronto, New York City and Mumbai. Hence, to develop an Influence Diagram that models the 
impact of the different degrees of regulations on the consequences failures of elevator devices have on users. The purpose of doing this project is to address a growing concern 
among users of EDs on the potential risk and unavailability issue it is causing in the community today.

Initially, a background review of the different types of EDs and safety steps to be carried out on EDs was studied, along with the currently available safety devices installed on 
EDs, as a best practice for ED authority to enforce and users to follow. Then a current account on the ED availability in each of the cities was studied. After that, a detailed 
review on the present situation of each region’s EDs hazard occurrences; standards, laws, regulations and codes pertaining to buildings and EDs were explored. Quantitative and
qualitative data relevant to the objective were gathered and presented in tables and diagrams. This constituted the first part of the objective, which was to be used as the input
to the second part.

Various risk modelling methods such as Petri Nets, Bow-Tie, Fault Tree Analysis, Bayesian Nets, etc. were reviewed. Its applications and previous research done on modelling 
elevator risk were studied and evaluated. Their features and benefits were assessed, and BBN was chosen as the method to model the data, as it suited the type of uncertain and
missing information present in the collected data. Upon further review, Influence Diagram, an extension of Bayesian Nets, was used to model the objective, as it involved making 
certain decisions and associated consequences. This was supported by Influence Diagrams.

‘Netica’ from Norsys Software Corp was the tool used to model the problem. The key variables, decision and consequence nodes were chosen from the data gathered, that represented
the problem. The nodal probabilities were populated based on insights from research. The Influence Diagram was developed, and the model was tested using several scenarios relevant
to the problem. It was found that the model was able to advice on a course of action, upon processing different inputs, by taking into account its consequences.

The model’s benefits and limitations were assessed by reviewing the extent to which it achieved its purpose.
